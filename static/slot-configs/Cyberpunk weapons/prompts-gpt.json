    "10": "Create an image of the number '10' integrated with a high-tech cyberpunk weapon theme. The number should appear to be forged from advanced, lightweight alloys with intricate circuit-like patterns illuminating from within. The predominant colors should be neon blue and electric purple, against a gritty urban backdrop often seen in cyberpunk aesthetics. The image should be rendered in a 3D perspective to give a sense of depth and reality to the symbol.",
    "J": "Craft an image of the letter 'J' combining elements of a cyberpunk weapon. The letter should be stylized with sleek metallic edges, incorporating glowing lines of neon green that resemble the futuristic design of cutting-edge weaponry. Add visual elements reminiscent of power cores or energy cells that power cybernetic enhancements in a cyberpunk universe. The overall design should maintain consistency with the '10' symbol, featuring a similar color scheme and urban-industrial backdrop.",
    "Q": "Design an image of the letter 'Q' merging with a cyberpunk weapon theme. The letter should be represented with a gunmetal finish and adorned with hot pink neon accents tracing the contours. Incorporate visual cues such as targeting reticles or holographic sights that are characteristic of advanced firearms in a cyberpunk world. The image should align with the theme established by the '10' and 'J' symbols, displaying a harmonious design language and back-alley setting.",
    "K": "Generate an image of the letter 'K' that looks like a piece of cyberpunk weaponry. The 'K' should be constructed from a dark chrome material, edged with sharp, clean lines and highlighted with rivets or mechanical motifs in a bright cyan glow. Elements like wires or cables could subtly intertwine with the letter, suggesting a fusion of machine and typographic form. Ensure visual coherence with the previous symbols, retaining the cyberpunk noir environment.",
    "A": "Imagine the letter 'A' as part of a cyberpunk arsenal, with robust armored plating infused into its structure. The 'A' should have a rugged, battle-worn look, treated with a patina that glows with a fiery red-orange hue, reminiscent of heated metal. Incorporate aspects like ammunition belts or plasma conduits to enhance the military aspect of the cyberpunk genre. The design should complement the preceding symbols, with a dystopian sky-line silhouette in the background.",
    "m1": "Envision a unique cyberpunk melee weapon for the 'm1' symbol. The weapon should be a fusion of a traditional Japanese katana with neon-lined edges, giving off an electric teal luminescence. Its handle could be a combination of worn leather and futuristic carbon composites, with visible energy coursing through it. This blade should stand out against a smog-filled Tokyo cityscape at dusk.",
    "m2": "For the 'm2' symbol, create an image of an iconic cyberpunk firearm: a sleek, neon-highlighted pistol with digital ammo count displays built into its side. Integrate advanced materials like black matte nanofibers and chrome detailing, which catch reflections from the glow of the distant city advertisements in a perpetual night setting.",
    "m3": "Construct the image of an advanced cyberpunk projectile launcher for the 'm3' symbol. This heavy weapon should have a bulky design with a rotating barrel assembly, accented with pulsating orange and red lights denoting its charged state. Set this powerhouse against a background of rain-slicked streets reflecting the neon sprawl overhead.",
    "m4": "Develop the image of a high-tech cyberpunk energy rifle for the 'm4' symbol. Imagine it with sleek curves and surfaces that have a holographic and translucent quality, lit from within by swirling indigo and violet energies. Its design should hint that itâ€™s powered by a contained singularity, and it's set against a dimly lit alley with neon graffiti splattered on the walls, giving a sense of urban decay.",
    "wild": "Generate a visually striking image depicting the word 'wild' as a symbol of unbridled cyberpunk energy. The typography should be bold and futuristic, with sharp angles and overlaid with a circuitry pattern that pulses with multicolored lights. Incorporate into the design a holographic effect that makes the word seem to pop and rotate out of a solid black background. Emphasize the text with an aura of electric sparks or plasma flares to create a dynamic and exuberant atmosphere. Place the 'wild' word centrally and illuminate it with spotlights that cut through the surrounding darkness, drawing all attention to its vibrant details."
