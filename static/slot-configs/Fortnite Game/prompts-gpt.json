{"10":"Create an image symbol representing the number '10', styled as if it's built from Fortnite materials like wood, brick, and metal. Keep the design sleek and on-theme with Fortnite's aesthetic, resembling the construction elements used in the game. The '10' should be three-dimensional, with a touch of blue glow that reflects Fortnite's shield potion color.","J":"Design an image symbol of the letter 'J' stylized with elements from the Fortnite game. Integrate the iconic Fortnite purple storm as a background element, with lightning arcing across the 'J' contour. Keep the 'J' bold and prominent, paying homage to Jumpman's silhouette or a character parachuting into the battle zone.","Q":"Generate a symbol for the letter 'Q' infused with the Fortnite game's quirky aesthetic. The 'Q' could be designed as a loop from a bouncing tire or tire swing found on the Fortnite island. The overall feel should convey motion and fun, possibly with a Cuddle Team Leader-inspired pink and a touch of whimsicality like a small plush cuddle bear hugging the 'Q's tail.","K":"Craft an intricate and stylistic 'K' symbol influenced by Fortnite's iconic pickaxe. Incorporate visual elements reminiscent of the game's harvesting tools into the 'K', with a sharp angle and materials that suggest a crystalline or icy texture, in line with the in-game Chiller Grenade or Frostbite series skins.","A":"Illustrate the letter 'A' as a symbol, inspired by Fortnite's classic Victory Royale emblem. Draw emphasis on the 'A' with a victorious golden theme and include motifs like a laurel wreath or a miniature victory umbrella incorporated into the design to suggest triumph and achievement within the Fortnite universe.","m1":"Construct an image for a unique symbol called 'm1', which takes inspiration from Fortnite's supply drop. The image should feature an aerial loot crate, caught mid-descent by a bright yellow balloon, detailed with a red 'X' that stays true to the game's style, but avoid any overt text or numbers.","m2":"Develop an image for the 'm2' symbol, channeling the essence of a Fortnite chug jug. This symbol should depict a glowing, cool blue potion bottle wrapped in a metallic casing. Include fine details like condensation beads on the bottle hinting at the refreshing effect of the chug jug, but keep it free from text.","m3":"Create an image for 'm3', drawing from Fortnite's famous Battle Bus. The symbol should feature the bus flying through the air with a hot air balloon, decorated with vibrant llama patterns and the battle bus banner. Focus on capturing the bus's iconic blue and white color scheme, and its festive, ready-for-battle vibe.","m4":"Form an image symbol for 'm4' that represents a treasure chest from Fortnite. Illustrate an ornately carved wooden chest that's overflowing with glowing loot, such as weapons, ammunition, and building supplies. Illuminate the chest with a mystical light effect that accentuates the allure of the treasures within.","wild":"Render a dynamic and captivating 'wild' symbol that crystallizes the thrill of Fortnite gameplay. Envision a battle scene where loot, characters, and elements like the Boogie Bomb explode outwards in a vibrant spree. Overlay the action with the word 'wild', using a distinct, energetic font that's embellished with a spectrum of luminescent colors characteristic of Fortnite's Slurp Juice. The dazzling composition should pop against a deep black background, with focused lighting to enhance the spectacle."}
