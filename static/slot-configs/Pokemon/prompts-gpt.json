{"10":"Create an image of the number '10' with a Pokemon theme, illustrated as if it were carved out of a flat, smooth stone tablet, with a bas-relief of small, common Pokemon like Pidgey and Rattata playfully interacting around the numbers. The tablet is to be a pale lavender hue, reminiscent of Pokemon's 'Ghost' type color palette, with the number '10' in a bold, readable font and styled to show slight wear, as though weathered by time in a Pokemon universe.","J":"Design a distinctive image of the letter 'J' in the style of a Pokemon gym badge, incorporating elements of the Electric type Pokemon such as Pikachu.

It should look shiny and metallic, suitable for a slot machine symbol.","Q":"Construct a visual of the letter 'Q' inspired by the 'Queen' of Pokemon, embodying the grace of legendary Psychic type Pokemon. The letter should be adorned with a royal purple and pink color scheme, and the elegant psychic swirls of Mew or Espeon. The 'Q' should appear slightly raised against a background that contains a faint, celestial motif.","K":"Develop an image of the letter 'K' that embodies the Kingly aspect of Pokemon, in particular, resembling a Fire type like Charizard. The 'K' should be stylized with an ornate design, appearing as though it is forged from flames and charred metal, with a bold and imposing presence. It should have rich orange, red, and black tones to suggest a fiery texture.","A":"Craft an image of the letter 'A' that combines aspects of the Grass type Pokemon, such as Bulbasaur or Chikorita, into its design. The letter should have various shades of green, with leaf-like textures and small vines wrapping around its structure, suggesting growth and vitality. The 'A' should give the impression of being alive with Pokemon energy and natural vigor.","m1":"Generate an image of the water type Pokemon, Squirtle, playfully spraying water from its mouth, shaped into the symbol 'm1'. The Squirtle should be striking a dynamic pose with water droplets shimmering around it against a sea-blue watery backdrop, capturing the essence of the Water type in the Pokemon universe.","m2":"Create an image that features the electic Pokemon, Pikachu, launching a powerful Thunder Shock attack, which forms the symbol 'm2'. The Pikachu should appear energetic and radiant against a sparking electric-yellow background, with crackling energy bolts emphasizing its Electric type heritage.","m3":"Conceive an image that portrays the fire type Pokemon, Charmander, with its flaming tail crafting the symbol 'm3'. The Charmander should be depicted basking in a warm glow, with the fire from its tail casting dancing shadows and light on a background suggestive of volcanic activity and fiery terrain.","m4":"Visualize an image that showcases the grass type Pokemon, Bulbasaur, using Vine Whip to shape the symbol 'm4'. The Bulbasaur should be illustrated amidst a lush, leafy environment with its vines elegantly crafting the 'm4' amid a fresh, vibrant green setting, embodying the essence of Grass type habitats.","wild":"Create an awe-inspiring image of the word 'wild' in a dynamic and vivid display, interwoven with images of various iconic Pokemon like Mewtwo, Rayquaza, and Lugia. The text should be in a vibrant, stylized font, bursting with energy and legendary power, set against a dramatic black background. The word 'wild' should be the focal point, surrounded by a halo of intense, kaleidoscopic light that frames it and gives an effect of sparkling rarity, suggesting a special event or a rare encounter in the Pokemon world."}
