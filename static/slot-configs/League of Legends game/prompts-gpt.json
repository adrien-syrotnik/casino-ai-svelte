Each tail should be visually distinct, with ethereal wisps of energy trailing off as they gracefully arch around a central, mystical orb. This orb serves as Ahri's nexus of power, pulsating with a soft, enchanting light. The image needs to convey both the elegance and danger inherent in Ahri's character.","m2":"Design a large symbol 'm2' depicting Thresh's iconic lantern.
