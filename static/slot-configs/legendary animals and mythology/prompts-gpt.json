{"10":"Create an image of the number '10', styled to look ancient and mystical, embedded with iconography and small figures of legendary animals such as griffins and phoenixes, integrated into the contours of the number. The background should be an ethereal landscape reminiscent of a realm from mythology, perhaps with a glimpse of the legendary Yggdrasil tree. The design should have a cohesive ancient rune-like aesthetic, with the number '10' appearing to be carved out of stone and entwined with magical vines.","J":"Design the letter 'J' as a majestic symbol, forging it from mythological weaponry like the gleaming swords of ancient warriors or the lightning bolts of Zeus. Entwine it with smaller elements such as the feathers of Pegasus or the scales of a Chinese dragon, seamlessly blending into the design. Set against a celestial sky that hints of a great battle between gods and titans, with clouds parting around the letter, illuminating it as if it's chosen by fate.","Q":"Render the letter 'Q' as an enchanted artifact, wrapped with the silk of a unicorn's mane and the gems commonly associated with the crowns of fairy queens. Intertwine the curves of the 'Q' with delicate tendrils representing the forest of an elven kingdom, with silhouettes of mythical creatures like dryads and ents in the distance. Have the tail of the 'Q' be graced by a subtle wisp of dragon's smoke, indicating a hidden lair beyond the magical foliage.","K":"Illustrate the letter 'K' to reflect regal and mythical stature, with each stroke being an elegant column reminiscent of Atlantis' lost architecture. The intersections should be adorned with the laurels of victory and the wings of a Pegasus. Let it stand before a backdrop suggesting the underwater city, with the light filtering through the water casting an otherworldly glow on the 'K' and shadows of sea serpents lurking in the periphery.","A":"Craft the letter 'A' as a symbol of primordial power, with each leg resembling the towering legs of the Colossus of Rhodes and the crossbar being a detailed Norse longship indicative of exploration and conquest. The peak of the 'A' touches the sky where mythic thunderbirds soar. Let the backdrop be an ageless starry night, with constellations telling tales of ancient heroism and mythological conquests slowly moving behind the letter.","m1":"Generate an image of a Griffin, perched majestically atop a craggy mountain peak, with its eagle head held high and its lion tail curling behind it. The Griffin should be poised as if guarding a treasure, with the sunrise casting golden highlights on its feathers and fur. Infuse the image with a sense of noble strength and legendary status.","m2":"Create a visual of a Phoenix in mid-resurrection, bursting into flames with vibrant hues of reds, oranges, and yellows, against the backdrop of a twilight sky. As the mythical bird is reborn from its ashes, its wings should be spread wide, hinting at the powerful life force and rejuvenation central to its legend.","m3":"Depict a Cerberus, the fearsome three-headed dog from Greek mythology, guardianship emphasized by the shadows of the underworld and somber tones. The three heads should all have distinct expressions of vigilance, wrath, and eerie calm, with glowing eyes that pierce any observer, ensuring a commanding presence within the symbol.","m4":"Illustrate the majestic Sleipnir, Odin's eight-legged horse, in a frozen Norse landscape. Capture the sense of motion as it gallops through the snow, its multiple legs a blur of raw speed and supernatural agility. Let the Northern Lights play above serving as a powerful symbol of its otherworldly origin.","wild":"Conjure an image of a dynamic and eye-catching 'wild' symbol, encapsulated within a frame of intricate Greek-inspired golden filigree. The word 'WILD' should be prominently displayed across the center in a stylized font that appears to be forged from celestial fire, alive and crackling with energy. The backdrop should be a deep, cosmic black that suggests the vastness of space, allowing the vibrant colors of the 'wild' to leap out. Strategically position a dramatic light source, as if Helios's sun chariot is illuminating the symbol directly, to create stark contrasts and a sense of radiant power. Ensure a balanced composition, with the 'wild' centrally positioned to draw the eye and command attention."}
